Purpose of the Project:

Whispering Witches is a magical adventure game where players restore destroyed villages by defeating the evil goblins using magical potions. This project aims to raise awareness about the risks for environmental pollution among the young players and encourage them to participate in restoration through the interactive gameplay of saving destroyed villages. This would highly induce pathos among the users as it bridges fantastical storytelling to actively promote real-world sustainability themes. Furthermore, by incorporating AI models, we try to create a more visually engaging and magical experience for the users.

Tools Utilized: 

•	Blender for 3D game object modeling
•	Unity Engine to make the actual gaming layout
•	C#, Python to code our game.

Problems we ran into:

This being the third hackathon for us, we encountered a few problems in making this project. Faced with the limited timing of the hackathon, we were overwhelmed with the idea of working with Unity Engine to incorporate our AI models when some of our team members were more used with using Unreal Engine. We learned how to use that framework and pushed our limits to finalize the gameplay with a limited map size and fun magical objects. We initially faced trouble assembling the appropriate assets using Blender and displaying the walls in the game environment using brute force. Moreover, incorporating the API with AI was also one of the things we had issues working with for a long time.

Public frameworks used: 

Mixamo and Voice Chat API were some of the public frameworks used by us.
